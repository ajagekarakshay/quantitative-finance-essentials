# Random Variables

A random variable is a function that maps outcomes of a sample space to real numbers, defined as $X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$.
A random variable is discrete if it can take on a finite or countable number of values, and continuous if it can take on any value in a given interval.

A probability distribution is a function that maps outcomes of a random variable to probabilities, defined as $P(X = x)$.

## Normal Distribution

The normal distribution is a continuous distribution that is symmetric about the mean, with the probability density function:

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} $$

where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.
